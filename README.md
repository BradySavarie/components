<h1>üõ†Ô∏è Components</h1>

This repository holds a collection of web development components that have been coded from scratch. The purpose of creating this repository is not to use the components in live projects but to understand how each component functions from the ground up for when I inevitably get around to learning libraries such as React. I believe that diving into the mechanics of common UI elements now will help me have a better understanding in the future of how to modify/implement similar 3rd party code in my own projects. 

<i>Plus building fancy animated components is alot of fun.</i>
